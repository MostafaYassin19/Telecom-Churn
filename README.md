# Telecom-Churn
In the ever-evolving landscape of the telecom industry, understanding customer churn is paramount. Our project focused on deciphering the Customer Churn Rate and identifying key factors influencing it. We embarked on the challenge of designing a comprehensive Data Model, creating a dynamic Database, and delving into the intricate web of customer interactions.
Our Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) laid the foundation, mapping entities like Customers, Phone Services, Internet Services, Contracts, Churn Reasons, and more. Relationships were meticulously defined to unveil insights into customer behavior and service usage patterns.
As we set out to create the database using SQL Server, tables for Population, Location, Churn Categories, Churn Reasons, Contracts, Status, Customers, Internet Services, Phone Services, Customer Internet, and Call Center were meticulously crafted. Each table played a crucial role in capturing and organizing data, providing a 360-degree view of our telecom landscape.
Powerful SQL queries and views were then employed to extract meaningful insights:
We assessed the churn rate across various categories and identified the reasons driving customer departures.
Agents were ranked based on their impact on the churn rate, fostering a data-driven approach to improve service quality.
An exploration into the correlation between offers and churn rates shed light on customer preferences and satisfaction levels.
The usage patterns of internet services and phone services were dissected, allowing for tailored strategies to enhance customer experience.
Our project didn't stop at analytics; it paved the way for proactive measures. We implemented triggers and audits to keep a vigilant eye on customer updates, ensuring real-time tracking and accountability.
